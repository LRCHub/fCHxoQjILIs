I decided to leave home and family
And leave all the love I've known behind
Never thinking of the huddles I'll encounter
In search of the dream within my mind
It didn't matter when I left whose heart was broken
I didn't care how many tears were cried
I was determine within my heart to have my way now
And seek for the widest side of life
Shattered dreams
Shattered dreams
Nothing I've planned has turned out right
Shattered dreams
Shattered dreams
My life without Christ is shattered dreams
...Instrumental...
Getting home now
I need my fathers mercy
I have sinned and I know I've brought disgrace
I will ask him to forgive me though unworthy
I'll be so glad just to look upon his face
Shattered dreams
Shattered dreams
Nothing I've planned has turned out right
Shattered dreams
Shattered dreams
My life without Christ is shattered dreams
Repeat chorus ...
End...
