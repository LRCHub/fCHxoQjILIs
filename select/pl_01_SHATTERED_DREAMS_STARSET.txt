So much for your promises
They died the day you let me go
Caught up in a web of lies
But it was just too late to know
I thought it was you
Who would stand by my side
And now, you've given me, given me
Nothing but shattered dreams,
shattered dreams
Feel like I could run away, run away
From this empty heart, heart
No, no, no
You said you'd die for me
You said you'd die for me
Woke up to reality
And found the future not so bright
I dreamt the impossible
That maybe things would work out right
I thought it was you
Who would do me no wrong
And now, you've given me, given me
Nothing but shattered dreams,
shattered dreams
Feel like I could run away, run away
From this empty heart
No, no, no
You said you'd die for me
You said you'd die for me
From this empty heart
From this empty heart
You said you'd die for me
From this empty heart
You said you'd die for me
And now, you've given me, given me
Nothing but shattered dreams,
shattered dreams
Feel like I could run away, run away
From this empty heart
No, no, no
You said you'd die for me
You said you'd die for me
